 - Docker mounts /srv/sites/kbhff/kbhff_dk as 1000:1000, not as www-data:staff
   - Use volumes to mount the filesystem instead?
     - I don't think that will solve the problem, the issue is that it's mounted as the wrong user, not that it's mounted without being rw!
   - Try https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40462189/docker-compose-set-user-and-group-on-mounted-volume
 - Use docker to set hostname, not in the apache dockerfile
 - Write a Makefile that downloads git repositories and patches files as necessary
 - Should we mirror more volumes than just /srv/sites?
 - Use https://www.fromlatest.io/#/ to optimise dockerfile
 - Fix httpd.conf setup to make it more standard
 - Can we get a smaller image than the Ubuntu one?
   - We can split the ubuntu image into an apache image that proxies all its requests to a php image, both of which should be much smaller than the ubuntu image
   - If we successfully manage to get parentnode to update their apache configuration, this will be easier
 - conf-client/php-cli.ini and conf-client/php-apache2.ini seem to be identical; if docker is accepted, can we drop one of them and copy it to both locations?
 - Use volumes (different from the `volume` command!) to persist the database: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes
   - I think this is already happening
 - Patch the setup procedure so that the correct db names etc. are filled by default
